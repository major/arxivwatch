# MY INTERESTS

Consider my two main interests:

- Professional interests:
  I'm a python software developer and technical lead at Red Hat who is focused on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
  I'm very interested in open source technologies, artificial intelligence, model context protocol, retrieval-augmented generation, agentic workflows, information security, and performance tuning.
  I enjoy starting with a customer problem and working backwards to build great products.

- Personal interests:
  I love studying financial markets, including analysis of large datasets of financial data to extract patterns.
  I work with large datasets in polars and look for signs of institutional movements in various stocks and ETFs.
  My main focus is tracking price, volume, and how the two interact with each other.
